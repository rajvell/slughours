<h3> Hours of Operations </h3>

<p>When making this website, the goal we had in mind was to have one unified place where UCSC student's can find
    the hours of operation for various different facilities on campus in one place. The problem that arises
    with googling for hours of a facilities is that there is no one easy place to find the hours in one place. Often
    times people also have a hard time finding the hours of some facilities as it is hidden deep within websites which
    is hard to navigate to.
